# Overview

In this workshop, we delve into two key concepts in blockchain technology: "Account Abstraction" and the "NFT Authenticator." These concepts are designed to simplify and enhance the usability of blockchain systems, making them more accessible and user-friendly.

## Workshop Agenda

In this workshop, we will explore the Authenticator module and package, followed by a practical exercise of creating a concrete authenticator in Golang.

```go
1. *Presentation:* This session provides an overview of Account Abstraction and sets the stage for the workshops topics.

2. *Exploring the Authenticator Module:* We will conduct an in-depth review of the Authenticator module within the Osmosis Node codebase.

3. *Understanding Authenticator Architecture:* Dive into the architectural aspects of the authenticator module, gaining insights into its design and functionality.

4. *Comprehensive Authentication Techniques:* Explore various authentication methods, including signature-based, passkey-based, and spend limit-based authenticators.

5. *Combining Authenticators:* Learn how to compose multiple authenticators to create complex and secure authentication processes.

6. *Initiating the NFT Authenticator Workshop:* Start the NFT Authenticator workshop, applying your knowledge to a practical implementation.
```

This session will give insights into enhancing the security and usability of the Osmosis blockchain with a reference implementation of an authenticator.
