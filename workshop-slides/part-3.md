## Authenticators

**What are Osmosis Authenticators?**

Osmosis Authenticators are integral components of the blockchain system that serve as code snippets responsible for governing access to user accounts. These authenticators play a crucial role in enhancing the usability of blockchain technology by simplifying and securing the interaction between users and the blockchain.

Authenticators are designed to abstract away many of the complexities associated with account management and transaction validation, providing a smoother and more user-friendly experience. They serve as gatekeepers, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions and credentials to perform specific actions on the blockchain.
