# Overview

In this workshop, we delve into two key concepts in blockchain technology: "Account Abstraction" and the "NFT Authenticator." These concepts are designed to simplify and enhance the usability of blockchain systems, making them more accessible and user-friendly.

## Account Abstraction

**What Is Account Abstraction?**

Account Abstraction is a concept aimed at simplifying blockchain interactions by moving beyond the traditional single-key, single-account approach. It seeks to remove complexities typically associated with blockchain transactions, offering users a more straightforward and flexible way to engage with these systems.

**How Does Account Abstraction Improve Usability?**

Account Abstraction significantly enhances usability by eliminating technical barriers that users often encounter when dealing with blockchain systems. Users can now perform actions and transactions without needing an in-depth understanding of the underlying blockchain mechanics. This concept paves the way for a more user-friendly experience, potentially increasing adoption and expanding access to previously unavailable services.

## Authenticators

**What are Osmosis Authenticators?**

Osmosis Authenticators are integral components of the blockchain system that serve as code snippets responsible for governing access to user accounts. These authenticators play a crucial role in enhancing the usability of blockchain technology by simplifying and securing the interaction between users and the blockchain.

Authenticators are designed to abstract away many of the complexities associated with account management and transaction validation, providing a smoother and more user-friendly experience. They serve as gatekeepers, ensuring that users have the appropriate permissions and credentials to perform specific actions on the blockchain.

To delve deeper into the specifics of Osmosis Authenticators, you can explore the [Osmosis Authenticator Module](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/account-abstraction-main/x/authenticator) and the [Osmosis Authenticator Interface](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/account-abstraction-main/x/authenticator/iface/iface.go). These resources provide a comprehensive understanding of how authenticators are implemented and utilized within the Osmosis blockchain ecosystem.

## (The Authenticator Interface)[https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/blob/account-abstraction-main/x/authenticator/iface/iface.go]

```golang
// Authenticator is an interface employed to encapsulate all authentication functionalities essential for
// verifying transactions, paying transaction fees, and managing gas consumption during verification.
type Authenticator interface {
	// Type defines the various types of authenticators, such as SignatureVerificationAuthenticator
	// or CosmWasmAuthenticator. Each authenticator type must be registered within the AuthenticatorManager,
	Type() string

	// StaticGas specifies the gas consumption enforced on each call to the authenticator.
	StaticGas() uint64

	// Initialize is used when an authenticator associated with an account is retrieved
	// from storage. The data stored for each (account, authenticator) pair is provided
	// to this method. For instance, the SignatureVerificationAuthenticator requires a PublicKey
	// for signature verification, we can Initialize() the code with that data,
	Initialize(data []byte) (Authenticator, error)

	// GetAuthenticationData retrieves any required authentication data from a transaction.
	// It returns an interface defined as a concrete type by the implementer of the interface.
	GetAuthenticationData(
		ctx sdk.Context, 
		tx sdk.Tx, 
		messageIndex int, 
		simulate bool, 
	) (AuthenticatorData, error)

	// Track is used for authenticators to track any information they may need regardless of how the transactions is
	// authenticated. For instance, if a message is authenticated via authz, ICA, or similar, those entrypoints should
	// call authenticator.Track(...) so that the authenticator can know that the account has executed a specific message
	Track(
		ctx sdk.Context, 
		account sdk.AccAddress, 
		msg sdk.Msg, 
	) error

	// Authenticate validates a message based on the signer and data parsed from the GetAuthenticationData function.
	// It returns true if authenticated, or false if not authenticated. This function is used within an ante handler.
	// Note: Gas consumption occurs within this function.
	Authenticate(
		ctx sdk.Context, 
		account sdk.AccAddress, 
		msg sdk.Msg, 
		authenticationData AuthenticatorData, // The authentication data is used to authenticate a message.
	) AuthenticationResult

	// ConfirmExecution is employed in the post-handler function to enforce transaction rules,
	// such as spending and transaction limits. 
	ConfirmExecution(ctx sdk.Context, account sdk.AccAddress, msg sdk.Msg, authenticationData AuthenticatorData) ConfirmationResult

	// OnAuthenticatorAdded is called when an authenticator is added to an account. If the data is not properly formatted
	// or the authenticator is not compatible with the account, an error should be returned.
	OnAuthenticatorAdded(ctx sdk.Context, account sdk.AccAddress, data []byte) error

	// OnAuthenticatorRemoved is called when an authenticator is removed from an account.
	// This can be used to update any global data that the authenticator is tracking or to prevent removal.
	OnAuthenticatorRemoved(ctx sdk.Context, account sdk.AccAddress, data []byte) error
}
```

## NFT Authenticator

**What is the NFT Authenticator?**

The NFT Authenticator is a type of Authenticator designed to streamline transactions by leveraging Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). By using the NFT Authenticator, an NFT minter can send an NFT to an address, allowing that address to transact on behalf of the original owner address. 

**Workflow with the Osmosis Token Factory**

Here's a simplified example of how the NFT Authenticator works in conjunction with the Osmosis Token Factory:

```go
1. *Alice* mints an NFT using the Osmsois Token Factory.

2. *Alice* now possesses the NFT.

3. *Alice* decides to send the NFT to *Bob*.

4. *Bob* wants to perform a transaction on behalf of *Alice*, so they sign a transaction with *Alice* as the sender (since *Alice* is the minter).

5. The NFT Authenticator checks that *Bob* has signed the transaction and the NFT in their account.

6. The transaction is successful because *Bob* has the NFT and the signature is correct.

7. *Chris* feel left out and tries to send transactions on behalf of *Alice* but fails.

8. The spend limit authenticator and NFT authenticators together can be used with an AllOf authenticator to ensure secure and controlled transactions.
```

### How to run the example

```bash
go test ./... -v -run TestAuthenticatorSuite/TestRoundTripAliceBobAndChris
```
